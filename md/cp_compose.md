## How to learn composing counterpoint

Use [Counterpoint exercise builder](editor.html?action=cantus) to learn composing counterpoint

It is recommended to start with 2 voices:
- Compose in first species
- Compose in second species
- Compose in third species
- Compose in forth species
- Compose in fifth species

For each species:
- Start with shorter cantus, then compose with longer.
- Start with cantus firmus in lower voice, then compose with cantus firmus in higher voice.
- First start with C major key, then try other major keys. After that compose in A minor key, then try other minor keys.
- Start with 4/4 time signature, then try 3/4, 5/4 and other.
- Compose counterpoint exercises for different combinations of vocal ranges (soprano-alto, alto-tenor, teno-bass and other).

After that move to 3 voices and 4 voices.

If you cannot use counterpoint exercise builder, here is a collection of cantus firmus that you can use to compose. Each cantus firmus can be used in any of species, keys and time signatures:
