## How to start composing counterpoint

To learn how to compose counterpoint, it is recommended to start with 2 voices:
- Compose in first species
- Compose in second species
- Compose in third species
- Compose in forth species
- Compose in fifth species

For each species:
- Start with shorter cantus, then compose with longer.
- Start with cantus firmus in lower voice, then compose with cantus firmus in higher voice.
- First start with major key C, then try other major keys. After that compose in minor key Am, then try other minor keys.

Here is a collection of cantus firmus that you can use to compose. Each cantus firmus can be used for any of species:
